- Name: **SchoolSystemAdmin**
- Problem: solve the complexity of handling information about grades in schools in some regions where there is no access to software tools (specifically in Latin America).

## Distinctiveness and complexity

1. The design of the project considered a real-life scenario in a real context.
    - Many teachers in remote regions in South America do not have access to software tools that supports their work with students, meaning, many of them have to manually print excel sheets to record grades of the Students.
    - Even though there are many tech companies and the products are available, the economic support is reduced due to multiple reasons.
    - This software project is a potential solution to that problem.

2. The design starts with the potential entities involved and their hierarchy, such as Students, Teachers, Grades, a Subject, a Program, and an Institution, so an Entityâ€“Relationship model diagram is included to record the relationship between them. 

    - ![ER Diagram](app2_school.png "Entity Relationship Diagram")

3. From 2., the relations are:
    - Institution is the main entity and will contain multiple Programs. 
    - Each Program, will contain multiple Subjects.
    - Each Subject, will contain multiple Students.
    - Each Subject, will also contain a Teacher associated.
    - Each Student, will have a set of grades associated to the subject registered.
    - Each Grade, will contain information about 4 exams, 3 main exams and 1 final with a weight associated.
    - These models, should be able to be read, be modified, be deleted and be edited. 
    - Possibly some restrictions like, avoid deletion since is entity is being used, so consistency of information is maintained.

4. The architecture is intended for the backend to be completely separated from the frontend.

5. After creating the Data model, the technology used for this web app is listed below:
    - Frontend: `React.js` since managing the information could be complex using vanilla javascript. The model in react is function, using React Hooks.
    - Some additional packages were installed in node.js in order to setup the react.js environment.
    - Css Framework: `bootstrap 5`, increase the usability with a modern interface.
    - `jwt` tokens. 
    - Backend: `Django` web framework.
    - Backend: `Django Rest Framework` (DRF) since is written in python and leverage the knowledge already acquired.

6. The complexity is justified, additionally by:
    - Creating the endpoints necessary in the API, with all the methods required to update, cerate, delete and view
    - Creating the necessary components to render, so the user can interact with the application.
    - The design of the data model that includes 6 django models that depends from each other in a hierarchy structure.
    - The front end, will handle specific behavior based on the page and the event caused (load, click on a button, change in a components).
    - Each event, has an interaction with the backend, and used POST to create, PUT to modify and GET to bring data.
    - Some unique data-structures and nested json fields were created in order to reduce the number of calls to the api to the minimum possible. 
    - The application in general is mobile-responsive, usable from mobile devices.

- The database used in this case, is primarly SQL-based.
- Compatible with MySQL, MariaDB and SQLite databases, since data is structured.
